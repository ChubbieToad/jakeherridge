        <h1>Jake Herridge</h1>
        
        <p>I'm a strategic operations leader who believes data should empower people, not overwhelm them. Over the past 5+ years, I've specialized in turning tangled processes into streamlined systems—but what truly excites me is leading teams to own those solutions. Whether it's redesigning performance reviews to cut administrative time in half and add five times the value or building customer scoring models that boost retention, I focus on aligning daily work with the bigger picture. Tools like Power BI and Power Automate are my allies, but my superpower is translating raw insights into actionable strategies that teams actually want to execute.</p>

        <p>As a leader, I operate like a strategic compass: I get into the trenches with my team to understand their pain points, then connect those dots to organizational goals. For example, by creating transparent dashboards that show how individual tasks ladder up to CEO-level priorities, I've helped teams shift from 'Why are we doing this?' to 'Here's how we'll win.' I thrive on fostering trust through clarity—no jargon, no hidden agendas—just a relentless focus on solving the right problems, in the right order, together.</p>

        <p>My approach? Listen first, automate second, and always keep the human impact in focus. I've earned praise from CEOs for my ability to bridge the gap between high-level vision and on-the-ground execution—turning what was ambiguity into a playbook that teams rally behind. For me, transparency isn't just a buzzword; it's the fuel that keeps everyone rowing in the same direction, even when tackling the most daunting of challenges.</p>

            <p>If your organization needs a leader who can turn operational chaos into momentum—where data drives decisions, teams feel heard, and 'how we've always done it' evolves into 'how we'll outpace the competition'—<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-herridge-2722b139/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let's connect</a>.<br><br>What's the #1 friction point keeping your team from aligning with your CEO's vision?</p>
